# ChatGPT-Infused Spaced Repetition System for Chinese Study

A Chinese learning toolkit for Mac/iOS based on what I call the **ARID Principles** of vocabulary acquisition: How can we simltaneously optimize the vocabulary acquisition process for:
- **A**ccessibility;
- **R**etention;
- **I**mmersion; and
- **D**ata?

# Introduction
In reference to the [ARID Principles](#chatgpt-infused-spaced-repetition-system-for-chinese-study), this program approaches Chinese vocabulary acquisition with the following priorities.

## Accessibility
### Of Input
Regardless of location and medium of interaction, learners should be able to access the card creation process without sacrificing any present immersion. 

This is accomplished via Alfred (Mac) and Siri (iOS) translation workflows which parse text, screenshot, audio, and photo input into flash cards. See [Creating Flashcards](#creating-flashcards).


## Retention
Learners should be algorithmically guided through the process of applying [Piotr Wozniak's 20 Rules of Knowledge Formulation](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) to acquire vocabulary. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) a

## Reviewing Flashcards in Anki
The Anki flashcard template seen below is designed with [Piotr Wozniak's 20 Rules of Knowledge Formulation](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) in mind. Take a look below.

1. **Do not learn if you do not understand.** Writing animations, example sentences, images, and audio are all immediately viewable upon flipping a card. What _isn't_ immediately avaiable is pinyin or English versions of the auxillary data; those take an extra click. This challenges learners to understand new words 'in context', from both a textual and auditory perspective. [Conversing with PartnerGPT](#immersion) is a great way to understand new words as well, as a learner may ask questions to check comprehension. Finally, some example sentences are often determined based on the sentence a user originally asked PartnerGPT to translate; thus upon seeing a new card of this type they often immediately understand how to fit it into their overall picture of learned knowledge.

2. **Learn before you memorize.** Two on-flashcard tools are provided for this. The first is etymological: a small blurb detailing how the constituent characters relate (e.g., 眼鏡='eye'+'mirror' in the video). The second is orthographical: an analysis of the constituent components used in writing the characters and how they might convey its meaning. Probably the best way to learn brand new words is via the micro-lessons that [PartnerGPT conversations](#immersion) provide. 

3. **Build upon the basics.** When prompted with input, PartnerGPT creates flashcards out of _all_ different words found within, excluding any cards that already exist. This makes the learning process appear slow at first (in fact, I recommend using Anki rather than PartnerGPT for most practicing early on to most efficiently 'Easy' one's way through information they already know), but naturally calibrates the learner with a solid foundation upon which to build new knowledge. As [Dr. Wozniak](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) says, "Basics may also appear volatile and the cost of memorizing easy things is little... However, each memory lapse on basics can cost you dearly!".

4. **Stick to the minimum information principle.** This is the whole point of studying vocabulary! (As opposed to memorizing example sentences, grammar patterns, etc... those are better accomplished via other mediums of study.)

5. **Cloze deletion is easy and effective.** Chatting with PartnerGPT on **Review** mode allows a learner to answer cards based on filling-in-the-blanks of context sentences provided by the AI.

6. **Use imagery – a picture is worth a thousand words**. Done! 

7. **Use mnemonic techniques.** Clicking on the image in a card yields a mnemonic from ChatGPT which attempts to connect characters' meanings to the components of which they're comprised. This is extremely useful for practicing writing as well as reading! Mnemonic quality varies from clever to outlandish, but usually is at the least a good starting place to make one's own mnemonic.

8. **Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion.** I am not sure how to make this point relevant for language learning— ideas welcome!

9. **Avoid sets.** Done!

10. **Avoid enumeration.** Done!

11. **Combat interference.** As [Dr. Wozniak](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge) notes, there is nothing algorithmically that can be done here... interference strikes unpredictably and distinctly for every person. Thus, cards have a 'Usage Notes' field which can be filled in with extra examples, context cues, anecdotes, etc. to make them unique. (Of course, all other fields — image, example sentences, mnemonic, etymology — can be edited as well.)

12. **Optimize wording.** N/A.

13. **Refer to other memories.** Points (3) and Anki's spaced repetition algorithm in general are intended to help here, but — similar to point (11) — the onus of execution falls on the learner. _Use_ the '_Usa_ge Notes' field!
